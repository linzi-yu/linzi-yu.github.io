## Linzi Yu

### -- Who is She? --

Linzi Yu is a master's candidate in Biomedical Informatics at Harvard Medical School, graduating in December 2022. She received her Bachelor's degree - in Marine Science at Zhejiang University, one of the top 5 universities in China. She is passionate about implementing [diverse machine learning and data sciences tools](https://github.com/linzi-yu/ML-Models) to solve multilevel bio-medical-health-related questions. 

*Keywords: Disease Prediction; Deep Learning; Image Analysis; Database Infrastructure; Software Development*

With years of academic training and her career exploration in the biotech/healthcare industry, she dedicates herself to data-driven translational biomedical technologies, at least a ten years scope.


### -- Machine Learning, Data Related Research Experience--

She is a visiting student at Dr. Andrea Ganna's [Data Science - Genetic Epidemiology Lab](https://www.dsgelab.org/team). Here, she works on the effect of genome copy number variation on the patient healthcare cost in the Finnish population.

*Keywords: DiGeorge syndrome; GWAS; Human genetics; Public health*

She also joined [Dr. Arnaout's lab](http://arnaoutlab.org/) and a student researcher at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. She is currently working on implementing information technology (Maximum Entropy Model) and machine learning algorithms to deal with data augmentation in cardiological clinical data. The project is also collaborating with [Dr. Rima, cardiologist from UCSF](https://profiles.ucsf.edu/rima.arnaout).

*Keywords: Machine Learning; Information Theory; Data Sciences; Generative Algorithm; Generic Model; Maximum Entropy Model*


### -- Consulting Experience--

During the pandemic, she took a gap year to seek her career interests and potential in the industry. She started by joining IQVIA (Shanghai) management consulting team to analyze the landscapes of China's Oncology market ([her case interview deliverable]()). She maximized her passions and learning abilities by working with talents in such a high transforming environment. As a young graduate student just coming out of college, she is fascinated by the power she potentially has not only the academics but also in a business setting.


### -- IT company: Product manager or maybe software engineer? --

In a networking event, she got to know the CEO of an electronic lab notebook company, a PharmD with years of drug development experience in big Pharma. Though within the biotechnology industry, the company sought programmers with bio backgrounds to help them expand their business from chem to bioanalysis. The opportunity caught Linzi's eyes. She then got into the company as an assistant product manager. At the same time, the manager was generous in promising her a platform to learn and gradually fit into software engineer roles to develop bioinformatics tools for their potential clients. In this experience,  she learned how to communicate effectively with clients, product managers, and software developers in a small to medium-sized company. Bonusly, she learned how to use JavaScript to write front-end code.


### -- Join a startup as 1st Data Engineer and more --

She moved one step forward and met the CEO of [DelonixBioworks](https://delonixbio.com/). Delonix Bioworks is a synthetic biotech company that just received its $14 million seed funding that year. And Linzi became the first quantitative employee - data engineer - or bioinformatician in the biotech setting. She utilized the most updated databases and computational tools to help the scientific team with live-attenuated-vaccine development proposals. Apart from doing analytics tasks, she also helped recruit new employees, instructed interns to conduct pharmaceutical market research (what she learned from consulting experiences!), created a strain management database and website, and designed company apparel... She enjoys working at startups because she loves working on challenges and living with a growth mindset; above all, she enjoys being trusted. Trained as a bioinformatic scientist, she also acknowledged her potential in a speedily growing company, with the ambition of bringing more bench works to the bed.


### -- Boston, paradise for biotech startups -- 

In the summer of 2022, she joined Asan therapeutics, (not-even) a startup spun out from Bob Langer's lab at MIT. It was the first time she tried a business role to help the scientist to push their [research outcomes](https://news.mit.edu/2022/self-boosting-vaccines-0713) to the next level. She spent hours cold-emailing and cold-calling manufacturing companies to gather information on the feasibility and budgets of the platform technology.

Behind the scenes, she spends her leisure time dancing, reading, cooking, and hiking. She loves coffee and tea and dreams of opening an Asian Fusion Cafe after retiring.
